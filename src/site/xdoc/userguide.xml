<p>
ThreeTen-Extra is a small library that builds on the JDK 8 <code>java.time</code> library.
</p>
</section>


<section name="Value types">
<p>
The additional value types operate exactly as per similar classes in JDK 8.
</p>
</section>

<section name="Calendar systems">
<p>
The additional calendar systems operate exactly as per similar classes in JDK 8.
</p>
</section>


<section name="Time scales">
<p>
The JDK operates exclusively using the Java time-scale, defined in
<a href="http://download.java.net/jdk8/docs/api/java/time/Instant.html">Instant</a>.
That time-scale eliminates leap seconds using UTC-SLS, although the JDK implementation
is typically based on a POSIX-like clock (and thus relatively undefined around leap seconds).
</p>
<p>
ThreeTen-Extra provides the additional classes that were rejected from JDK 8.
They were not included as they were deemed to be too specialized for the JDK.
</p>
<p>
Use <code>TaiInstant</code> if you need an instant using the TAI time-scale.
</p>
<p>
Use <code>UtcInstant</code> if you need an instant using the UTC time-scale.
The leap second data is provided in a text file loaded via the <code>ServiceLoader</code>.
Only whole leap seconds are handled, and data starts from 1972 by default.
