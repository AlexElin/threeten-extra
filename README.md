threeten-extra
==============

ThreeTen-Extra provides additional date-time classes that complement those in JDK 8.

Not every piece of date/time logic is destined for the JDK.
Some concepts are too specialized or too bulky to make it in.
This project provides some of those additional classes as a well-tested and reliable jar.
