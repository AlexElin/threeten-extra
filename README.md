threeten-extra
==============

ThreeTen-Extra provides additional date-time classes that complement those in JDK 8.

Not every piece of date/time logic is destined for the JDK.
Some concepts are too specialized or too bulky to make it in.
This project provides some of those additional classes as a well-tested and reliable jar.


### Documentation
Various documentation is available:

* The [home page](http://www.threeten.org/threeten-extra/)

### Releases
Release 0.9 is the current development release intended for feedback.
The code is fully tested, but there may yet be bugs and the API may yet change.
There should be no great reason why it cannot be used in production if you can cope with future API change.

The project runs on JDK 8 and has no dependencies.

Available in the [Maven Central repository](http://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails|org.threeten|threeten-extra|0.9|jar)
